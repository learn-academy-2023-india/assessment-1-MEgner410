# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: a action that happenes to tell the program that it is eiter true or false

Researched answer: a sequential set of instructions computers use to make decisions.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a local software that allows changes in a prograhm that will be tracked. 

github is a remote space were develpers can store, update, and make changes as well as clone branches

Researched answer: git : a tool use to allow soure code  repositories. it allows featuers such as, branching and staginging areas.

github: the collabration platform build on top of git, you can push, and pull repositories so that developers can make needed changes on a prograhm. the programs can be tested to allow for feedback in the community.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: an array's index will list the data inside either zero-indexed (0,1,2,3) or not (1,2,3,4) ,
 the value: is the data that is stored as variables in the array. 


Researched answer: index used as a place holder in the value of the array

  value: is used to define the varuables types being used in the indexs

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays identified in code by [] brackets, it is a similar type of data that are stored, and must be specifcally identified by a value also the size of an Array is fixed. 
 ex. console.log [2,3,4,5,6,]

strings:  are identified by "". they contain a sequence of charators that is not a primitive data type, and it can be changed. 
ex. console log "apples"

Researched answer: 
a collection of fixed-sized sequantial items with the same basic type is an Array.
in javascript strings bascily treat data as an object which repersents a sequence of charaters
 a string can be turned into a array with the command .split, where as an array can be turned back into a string with the command .join.

 A critical diffence between the two data types would be: when the strings data is administered it can be changed.
 Arrays are a cache of elements, that are in a contigous memory location. 
 Arrays can contain primitive and objections (non-primitive) sources. String and Array's are known to be similar data tyeps, with the diffrence being the charator type.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: the 4 pillars of object oriented programing are, inheritance(sharing of information), encapsulation (grouping of information), abstration (hiding of information), polymorphism (redifinding of information)



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: is a built in method in javascript that functions as a argument

2. Jest: a testing framework for javascript, they contain a collection of files called dependencies

3. Objects: a javascript data type that has collections of key:value pairs, obects can contain static information as wellas actions in the form methyod
